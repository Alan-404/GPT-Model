what is machine learning? <sep> Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn.
what is deep learning? <sep> Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain
What are the different types of machine learning? <sep> Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are four basic approaches:supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The type of algorithm data scientists choose to use depends on what type of data they want to predict.
what is supervised learning? <sep> In this type of machine learning, data scientists supply algorithms with labeled training data and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess for correlations. Both the input and the output of the algorithm is specified.
What is unsupervised learning? <sep> This type of machine learning involves algorithms that train on unlabeled data. The algorithm scans through data sets looking for any meaningful connection. The data that algorithms train on as well as the predictions or recommendations they output are predetermined.
What is semi-supervised learning? <sep> This approach to machine learning involves a mix of the two preceding types. Data scientists may feed an algorithm mostly labeled training data, but the model is free to explore the data on its own and develop its own understanding of the data set.
What is reinforcement learning? <sep> Data scientists typically use reinforcement learning to teach a machine to complete a multi-step process for which there are clearly defined rules. Data scientists program an algorithm to complete a task and give it positive or negative cues as it works out how to complete a task. But for the most part, the algorithm decides on its own what steps to take along the way.
How does supervised machine learning work? <sep> Supervised machine learning requires the data scientist to train the algorithm with both labeled inputs and desired outputs. Supervised learning algorithms are good for the following tasks: <new_line> <list> Binary classification: Dividing data into two categories. <new_line> <list> Multi-class classification: Choosing between more than two types of answers. <new_line> <list> Regression modeling: Predicting continuous values. <new_line> <list> Ensembling: Combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models to produce an accurate prediction.
How does unsupervised machine learning work? <sep> Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not require data to be labeled. They sift through unlabeled data to look for patterns that can be used to group data points into subsets. Most types of deep learning, including neural networks, are unsupervised algorithms. Unsupervised learning algorithms are good for the following tasks: <new_line> <list> Clustering: Splitting the dataset into groups based on similarity. <new_line> <list> Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual data points in a data set. <new_line> <list> Association mining: Identifying sets of items in a data set that frequently occur together. <new_line> <list> Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the number of variables in a data set.
Explain what is an algorithm in computing? <sep> An algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that take some value as input and generate some value as output. In simple words, it’s a sequence of computational steps that converts input into the output.
what is computer vision? <sep> Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
what is linear regression? <sep> Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
what is kmean? <sep> k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. For instance, better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and k-medoids.
what is support vector machine? <sep> Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
what is nlp? <sep> Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.
What is natural language processing? <sep> Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. <new_line> NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.
what is generative model? <sep> Generative modeling is the use of artificial intelligence (AI), statistics and probability in applications to produce a representation or abstraction of observed phenomena or target variables that can be calculated from observations. <new_line> Generative modeling is used in unsupervised machine learning as a means to describe phenomena in data, enabling computers to understand the real world. This AI understanding can be used to predict all manner of probabilities on a subject from modeled data.
What is an algorithm? <sep> An algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that take some value as input and generate some value as output. In simple words, it’s a sequence of computational steps that converts input into the output.

how binary search works? <sep> In binary search, we compare the key with the item in the middle position of the array. If the key is less than the item searched then it must lie in the lower half of the array, if the key is greater than the item searched than it should be in upper half of the array.
What is Binary Search algorithm? <sep> Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

What is PyTorch? <sep> PyTorch is an optimized Deep Learning tensor library based on Python and Torch and is mainly used for applications using GPUs and CPUs. PyTorch is favored over other Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras since it uses dynamic computation graphs and is completely Pythonic.
